<ul>
  <li>
  <b>Step 1</b><p></p>Rescapp searchs for partitions that have on them the following file: <i>/etc/issue</i> based on information found in <i>/proc/partitions</i> file.
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Step 2</b><p></p>If such partitions have been found Rescapp presents you partitions that have on them the following file: <i>/etc/issue</i>. At the same time you are prompted:<p></p>
  <i>Which partition?</i><p></p> You are supposed to choose your main GNU/Linux distribution (probably you only will see one) and press the OK button.
  </li>

  <b>Step 3</b><p></p>You are prompted:<p></p><i>Which user?</i><p></p> Select the desired user from the list.
  </li>

  <li>
  <b>Step 4</b><p></p>Rescapp backups old /etc/sudoers file into /etc/sudoers_YYYY_... file and tries to setup a new /etc/sudoers file that includes the selected user only as sudo admin.
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Step 5</b><p></p>You are informed about /etc/sudoers creation process.<p></p>Message is self explanatory. You either get:<p></p><i>Success! Sudoers was changed OK! :)</i><p></p>or<p></p><i>Failure! Sudoers was not changed. Something went wrong! :(</i>
  </li>
<p></p><IMG SRC="images/sudoers_003_success.png"><p></p>
  <li>
  <b>Step 6</b><p></p>A log file called <i>sudoers.log.txt</i> can be found at Desktop <i>logs</i> folder.
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Step 7</b><p></p>Once you are able to gain admin privileges into your system you are advised to check if your sudoers file is correct depending on your distribution.
  </li>
</ul>
