  <b>Step 1</b><p></p>Rescapp searchs for primary partitions on your disk.
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Step 2</b><p></p>If such partitions have been found Rescapp presents you the partitions. At the same time you are prompted:<p></p>
  <i>Which partition?</i><p></p> You are supposed to choose your Windows (probably you only will see one) and press the OK button. If you have several Windows the best Windows to choose is the first one that you installed on your computer.
  </li>

  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Step 4</b><p></p>You are prompted:<p></p><i>Which hard disk to install Windows mbr on?</i><p></p> You are supposed to take a look at hard disk sizes (to be able to identify your hard disks) and choose (usually) the one that it is set to be first one to boot at your BIOS settings.

  <b>Step 6</b><p></p>Rescapp with all gathered information is going to set up a Windows mbr in your choosen hard disk so that the partition you have choose in booted at your machine boot.<b>Please wait</b>. Currently (Rescatux 0.23) this step is time consuming but no Please wait message has been implemented.

  <li>
  <b>Step 7</b><p></p>You are informed about the mbr installation process.<p></p>Message is self explanatory. You either get:<p></p><i>Success! Windows mbr was installed OK! :)</i><p></p>or<p></p><i>Failure! Windows mbr was not installed. Something went wrong! :(</i>
